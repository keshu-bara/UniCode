## 📚 About the Project

**Unicode** aims to solve a common challenge for developers: maintaining multiple profiles across different coding platforms.  
With Unicode, programmers can merge all their achievements, repositories, coding challenges, and skills into a **single, unified profile** — making it easier to showcase their coding journey professionally and efficiently.

⚡ **Note:** This project is currently **under active development**. Hosting and additional features are still in progress.
